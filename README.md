# NER_project_python
This is a project about NER (named entity recognition) for Chinese social media.

The model we have built is an attention-lstm model.

A linear-chain CRF is used to tag the feature vectors.

There are five types of entities which can be recognized by the extractor.(Person, Loction, Organization, Company, Product)

The corpus is from https://github.com/mswellhao/chineseNER/tree/master/KG/workDir/data.
